# FRC Engineering Concepts
*Introduction to fundamental engineering principles I used in FRC robotics.*

## Elevator Design
*Exploring the mechanics, motion profiling, and control systems behind single-stage elevators.*

### Abstract
This research explores the design and implementation of a single-stage elevator subsystem for an FRC robot.  
The system is powered by a single NEO motor with a chain-driven mechanism, integrating an **S-curve motion profile** for smooth movement.  

By structuring control with **state machines**, we aim to improve efficiency and maximize precision.  
This paper details the **mechanical setup, software design, and simulation results** of this subsystem.  

### Introduction
Elevators in FRC serve a crucial role in lifting game elements, often requiring **precise control** and **rapid response times**.  

Traditional elevator mechanisms used **PID control**, but sudden accelerations can lead to increased unreliability.  
To address these issues, our design incorporated the following:

- A **single-stage elevator** powered by a NEO motor, utilizing a **chain-driven mechanism** for vertical movement.  
- An **S-curve motion profile** to ensure smooth acceleration and deceleration, reducing mechanical stress and improving control.  
- A **state machine-based control system** to manage the elevator's operation, allowing for **precise positioning** and **efficient movement**.  
- **Integration of sensors** for feedback and error correction, enhancing reliability and performance.  

This paper discusses the **design trade-offs, control methods, and performance analysis**.
