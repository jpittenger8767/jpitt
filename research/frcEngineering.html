        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This research explores the design and implementation of a single-stage elevator subsystem for an FRC robot</p>
        <p>The system is powered by a single NEO motor with a chain-driven mechanism, integrating an S-curve motion profile for smooth movement</p>
        <p>By structuring control with state machines, we aim to improve efficiency and maxamize precision</p>
        <p>This paper details the mechanical setup, software design, and simulation results of implementation of this subsystem</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Elevators in FRC serve a crucial role in lifting game elements, often requiring precide control and rapid response times</p>
        <p>Traditional elevator mechanisms used PID control, but sudden accelerations can lead to increase in unreliability</p>
        <p>To address these issues, our design incorporated the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A single-stage elevator powered by a NEO motor, utilizing a chain-driven mechanism for vertical movement
            </li>
            <li>
                An S-curve motion profile to ensure smooth acceleration and deceleration, reducing mechanical stress and improving control
            </li>
            <li>
                A state machine-based control system to manage the elevator's operation, allowing for precise positioning and efficient movement
            </li>
            <li>
                Integration of sensors for feedback and error correction, enhancing the system's reliability and performance
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This paper discusses the design trade-offs, control methods, and performance analysis</p>
